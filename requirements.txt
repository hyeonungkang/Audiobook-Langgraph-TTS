google-generativeai>=0.3.0,<0.4.0

# New Gemini SDK (cookbook Audio-out: client.models.generate_content)
google-genai>=0.3.0

# Protobuf - CRITICAL: langgraph 1.0.4 works with protobuf 4.x
# opentelemetry-proto (dependency of langgraph 1.0.4) may work with protobuf 4.x
# If conflicts occur, we'll install compatible versions individually
protobuf>=4.0.0,<7.0.0

# It requires protobuf>=5.0,<7.0 which we've specified above
# This resolves the dependency conflict between opentelemetry-proto and google-generativeai
